🎯 Usage Examples
1. Face Mesh Detection
python
with mp_face_mesh.FaceMesh(static_image_mode=True) as face_mesh:
    image = cv2.imread('face_image.jpg')
    results = face_mesh.process(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
2. Pose Estimation
python
with mp_pose.Pose(static_image_mode=True, model_complexity=2) as pose:
    results = pose.process(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
3. Video Processing
python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('walking.mp4')
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, image = cap.read()
    results = pose.process(image)
